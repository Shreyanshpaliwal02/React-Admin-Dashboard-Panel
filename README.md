Announcement- I have tried to add a Node.js server and fetched the users and products table from MongoDB with the help of a friend, pushing the new update very soon as I work through everything :)
Please Note:
1. The app has now been connected to a database yet, dummy datasets were created by me.
2. This is not live yet (as I don't have the money to buy and host a domain yet :P), but it will run on your local machine.
( Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.1.8:3000)
3. It is not finished yet, links such as system health, notifications,settings, sign-in and log out have not been implemented yet. But I will continue to work on this app as I learn more React, this is just the beginning.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and can be used as a template for many applications such as Netflix, Amazon Shopping etc.
Imports - 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
